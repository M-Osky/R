# R
Some short R scripts I wrote to analyse my data.
This is just a sample of some of the work I have done with R.
I used most of those scripts long time ago and I do NOT recommend their use, some of them are really old.
I'm still working with the RMark scripts, those should be more updated. Recently found out I could improve some of the models (they weren't 100% correct) and as soon as I update them, they will be here. Feedback will be strongly appreciated.
Cheers!
