# R analysis
Some short R scripts I wrote to analyse my data.
This is just a sample of some of the work I have done with R.
I used most of those scripts long time ago and I do NOT recommend their use, some of them are really old.
In any case they include a few lines about the input file needed and so, so should be quite straigh forward to use them.
I'm still working (when I have time) with the RMark scripts, recently found out I could improve some of the models (they weren't 100% correct), as soon as I update them, they will be here. Feedback will be strongly appreciated.
Cheers!
