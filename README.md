# R
Some short R scripts I wrote to analyse my data.
This is just a sample of some of the work I have done with R.
I used some of those scripts long time ago. I do not recommend their use, as some of them are really old.
I'm still working with the RMark scripts, those should be more updated. I recently found some errors in some of the models and as soon as I update them they will be here. Feedback will be strongly appreciated.
Cheers!
