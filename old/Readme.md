# R analysis

Those are old R scripts I use for various purpouses.
I strongly recommend to use the ones in the parent directory, but it may be worth to check this two if you need simpler things.

Basically you have:
one-way ANOVA and t-test for Normal data
Kruskall-Wallis and Wilcoxon test for non-Normal
And multivariant analysis: PCA and LDA
They include a few lines about the input file needed and so, so should be quite straigh forward to use them.
Usually columns should be sorted as this: tags/descriptors (not analised), grouping variables, numerical variables.
